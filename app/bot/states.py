Shared State Definitions Module for Institution Complaint Management Bot

Centralized Conversation State Definitions for Institution Complaint Management Bot

This module serves as the central repository for all conversation state constants
used throughout the bot application. It ensures consistent state management and 
simplifies transitions between different conversation handlers.

All states are defined as sequential integers starting from 0, making them suitable
for use with python-telegram-bot's ConversationHandler.
