Your task is to act as an expert analysis engine. You will be given a user's complaint text.
You must carefully read the text, understand its full context, and then answer the following six questions.
Your final output must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object containing the answers to these six questions.
---

---
**User Complaint Text:**
{complaint_text}
---

**Analysis Questions:**

**Question 1: Criticality Assessment**
Based on your understanding of the complaint, you must determine if this complaint is critical. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "is_critical". The value must be a boolean (true or false).
Set the value to true ONLY if the complaint's content is related to any of the following topics, which are based on this list of keywords: [{critical_keywords}].
In all other cases, set the value to false.

**Question 2: Complaint Summary**
Based on your understanding of the complaint, provide a concise, one-sentence summary in English. The key for this answer must be "summary".
The summary must be neutral, factual, and capture the main point of the complaint.

**Question 3: Sensitivity Level
Based on your understanding of the complaint, you must assess its sensitivity level. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "sensitivity".
- You must choose ONLY ONE of the allowed levels specified here: [{allowed_sensitivities}].
+ You must choose ONLY ONE of the sensitivity level NAMES from the list below. The value in your JSON output should be the "name" of the level, not its description.

+ **Allowed Sensitivity Levels:**
+ {sensitivity_guidance}

Guidance for selection:
- You must assign the "sensitive" level if the complaint's content is related to any of the topics based on this list of keywords: [{critical_keywords}].
- In all other cases, you must assign the "insensitive" level.
+ Use the descriptions provided above for each level to make the most appropriate choice based on the complaint's content. For example, if the complaint involves personal data or safety, you should choose the level whose description matches that best.

**Question 4: Content Assessment**
Assess the nature of the content itself. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "content_assessment".
You must choose ONE of the following assessments: ["VALID", "SPAM", "ABUSIVE"].

**Guidance for selection:**
- **Important Note: If you have already determined in Question 1 that is_critical is true, you MUST classify this content as "VALID", regardless of its language.**
- "VALID": The text appears to be a genuine complaint or grievance, written in a coherent manner.
- "SPAM": The text is nonsensical, irrelevant, contains only advertising, is a random sequence of characters, or is clearly a test message.
- "ABUSIVE": The text contains hate speech, profanity, personal insults, or overly aggressive/threatening language that is not constructive to resolving the issue.

**Question 5: Complaint Category**
Classify the complaint into ONE of the following categories based on its primary subject matter. The key for this answer must be "complaint_category".
Allowed Categories: [{allowed_categories}].

Guidance for selection:
{category_guidance}

---
**Question 6: Sector Classification**
Classify the complaint into the MOST RELEVANT sector based on its content. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "sector".
You must choose ONLY ONE of the allowed sectors listed here: [{allowed_sectors}].

Guidance for selection:
{sector_guidance}
---

---
**Final Output Requirement:**
You MUST reply ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text, explanation, or markdown before or after the JSON object.
---
The JSON object must contain these six keys, and only these six keys: "is_critical", "summary", "sensitivity", "content_assessment", "complaint_category", and "sector".
