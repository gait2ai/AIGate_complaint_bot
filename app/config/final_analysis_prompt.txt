Your task is to perform a detailed and objective analysis of the user's complaint text provided below.
You must carefully read the complaint and provide your analysis strictly in a JSON object format, following all instructions precisely.

---
**User Complaint Text:**
{{complaint_text}}
---

**Analysis Instructions & Criteria:**

### 1. Complaint Category Analysis

**Task:** Classify the complaint into ONE of the following categories based on its primary subject matter. Choose the category that best represents the core issue of the complaint.
**Allowed Categories:** [{{allowed_categories}}]

**Guidance for selection:**
*   Focus on the main topic. If the complaint mentions multiple issues, identify the most significant one to determine the category. For example, a complaint about a rude employee during a service request is primarily "Employee Behavior", not "Service".
*   "Financial" relates to billing, payments, or financial loss.
*   "Service" relates to the quality or delay of a service provided.
*   "Administrative" relates to procedures, paperwork, or official processes.
*   "Employee Behavior" relates to the conduct of staff.
*   "Technical" relates to issues with systems, websites, or equipment.
*   Use "Other" if no other category fits well.

### 2. Sensitivity Level Analysis

**Task:** Assess the sensitivity of the complaint and assign it ONE of the following levels.
**Allowed Levels:** [{{allowed_sensitivities}}]

**Guidance for selection:**
*   **High:** Assign this level ONLY if the complaint involves serious allegations such as: sexual harassment, corruption, direct threats to physical safety, illegal activities, severe discrimination, or major data/privacy breaches.
*   **Medium:** Assign this level for issues that are serious but not critical, such as: repeated service failures affecting work, significant financial loss for the user, systemic problems affecting multiple people, or accusations of professional misconduct.
*   **Low:** Assign this level for most standard issues, such as: a single service delay, a minor billing error, a single rude interaction, or general operational inefficiencies.

### 3. Content Assessment

**Task:** Assess the nature of the content itself. You must assign ONE of the following assessments.
**Allowed Assessments:** ["VALID", "SPAM", "ABUSIVE"]

**Guidance for selection:**
*   **VALID:** The text appears to be a genuine complaint or grievance, written in a coherent manner.
*   **SPAM:** The text is nonsensical, irrelevant, contains only advertising, is a random sequence of characters, or is clearly a test message.
*   **ABUSIVE:** The text contains hate speech, profanity, personal insults, or overly aggressive/threatening language that is not constructive to resolving the issue.

### 4. English Summary

**Task:** Provide a concise, one-sentence summary of the complaint in English. The summary must be neutral, factual, and capture the main point of the complaint.
