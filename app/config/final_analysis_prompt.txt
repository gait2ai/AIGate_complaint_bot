Your task is to act as an expert analysis engine. You will be given a user's complaint text.
You must carefully read the text, understand its full context, and then answer the following five questions.
Your final output must be ONLY a single, valid JSON object containing the answers to these five questions.

---
**User Complaint Text:**
{{complaint_text}}
---

**Analysis Questions:**

**Question 1: Criticality Assessment**
Based on your understanding of the complaint, you must determine if this complaint is critical. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "is_critical". The value must be a boolean (`true` or `false`).
Set the value to `true` ONLY if the complaint's content is related to any of the following topics, which are based on this list of keywords: [{{critical_keywords}}].
In all other cases, set the value to `false`.

**Question 2: Complaint Summary**
Based on your understanding of the complaint, provide a concise, one-sentence summary in English. The key for this answer must be "summary".
The summary must be neutral, factual, and capture the main point of the complaint.

**Question 3: Sensitivity Level**
Based on your understanding of the complaint, you must assess its sensitivity level. The key for this answer in the JSON output must be "sensitivity".
You must choose ONLY ONE of the allowed levels specified here: [{{allowed_sensitivities}}].

**Guidance for selection:**
*   You must assign the "sensitive" level if the complaint's content is related to any of the topics based on this list of keywords: [{{critical_keywords}}].
*   In all other cases, you must assign the "insensitive" level.

**Question 4: Content Assessment**
Assess the nature of the content itself. The key for this answer must be "content_assessment".
You must choose ONE of the following assessments: ["VALID", "SPAM", "ABUSIVE"].

Guidance for selection:
*   "VALID": The text appears to be a genuine complaint or grievance, written in a coherent manner.
*   "SPAM": The text is nonsensical, irrelevant, contains only advertising, is a random sequence of characters, or is clearly a test message.
*   "ABUSIVE": The text contains hate speech, profanity, personal insults, or overly aggressive/threatening language that is not constructive to resolving the issue.

**Question 5: Complaint Category**
Classify the complaint into ONE of the following categories based on its primary subject matter. The key for this answer must be "complaint_category".
Allowed Categories: [{{allowed_categories}}].

Guidance for selection:
{{category_guidance}}

**Final Output Requirement:**
You MUST reply ONLY with a single, valid JSON object. Do not add any text, explanation, or markdown before or after the JSON object.
The JSON object must contain these five keys, and only these five keys: "is_critical", "summary", "sensitivity", "content_assessment", and "complaint_category".
